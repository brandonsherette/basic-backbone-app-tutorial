      While building out a web application, it may seem easier to build out 
      interactions with simple <b>jQuery</b> selectors and events, however as your 
      application grows, it can get tedious to work with. One solution is to use 
      a JavaScript framework to help separate and alleviate some of the common 
      tasks into a more manageable model and view structure. One such framework 
      is <a href="http://backbonejs.org/"><b>Backbone</b></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Backbone</b> is a more or less a more simple framework that allows you 
      quickly build out a web application using its many pre-built feature sets 
      such as, routing, models, and views.

      <h1>Tutorial Goals</h1>
    </header>
    <ul>
      <li>Install essential components.</li>
      <li>Build a simple web app using the Backbone.js Framework.</li>
      <li>Basic understanding of the following:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Views</li>
        <li>Models</li>
        <li>Routing</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Throughout this tutorial you will not only learn how to work with the <b>Backbone.js Framework</b>, 
      but also show you how to use <b>Backbone</b> in a small and simple application.
      While you continue to develop this simplistic Product Manager Application, 
      you will see how all the pieces fit together as a semi-finished product by 
      showing you one of my app/file structures I like to use, and utilize 
      <b>RequireJS</b> to modularize your application code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular tutorial is separated into four different parts.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="backbone-tutorial-part-1.html">Part 1</a></h2>
    <p>
      Part 1 is the current page you are on, and will discuss installing the required files 
      and going over the <b>app/file structure</b>.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="backbone-tutorial-part-2.html">Part 2</a></h2>
    <p>
      Part 2 deals with teaching some of the basics of <b>Backbone Views</b> and 
      some of its various ways of working with them and their respected html 
      templates.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="backbone-tutorial-part-3.html">Part 3</a></h2>
    <p>
      Part 3 deals with the introduction of <b>Backbone Models and Collections</b> while 
      also continuing to show different aspects of views. We will have our views 
      render with Product Models and end with dealing with looping through a collection 
      of products and rendering them to the user.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="backbone-tutorial-part-4.html">Part 4</a></h2>
    <p>
      Finally, we end with part 4 which deals with the introduction to <b>Backbone Routers</b>, 
      and flesh out the rest of the application with adding/editing/deleting 
      products.
    </p>

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>Before we start, we will need to download and setup a few things.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- 1.1 Installation -->
  <section>
    <header>
      <h1>1.1 Installation</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      I have a pre-built basic website built out and the required 
      files available for you to download at 
      <a href="github.com">www.github.com (update url).</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once downloaded, go ahead and take a quick look at take a look at the 
      contents of the directory. You will notice there are several folders 
      with the <b>backbone-tutorial</b> prefix. The <b>end</b> version is the completed 
      application from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of the tutorial, so if you are a more 
      of a tinkerer learner, go ahead and go through that folder and see the end
      results. The <b>start</b> version, is a clean starting copy that you will have 
      all the essential elements in place to start the tutorial. Finally, the 
      <b>walkthrough</b> version is the one you will actually go through the tutorial 
      with.

      <h1>1.2 App/File Structure</h1>
    </header>

    <p>
      Backbone doesn't really have a required file structure, you could in 
      fact have all your code in one JavaScript file, however I will be going 
      over one of the ways I like to structure my Backbone Applications, 
      which in turn, will help give you an idea how you can structure your own apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's first open up the <b>backbone-tutorial-walkthrough</b>, known from now on as the <b>root</b> directory, and 
      checkout what we have.
    </p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img src="images/backbone-tutorial-fig1_2a.jpg">
      <div class="fig-title">Fig 1.2 (root)</div>
    </div>

    <h2>File Structure Descriptions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>root/app</dt>
      <dd>The folder containing all application code, such as JavaScript and vendor files/libraries.</dd>
      <dt>root/styles</dt>
      <dd>Where your CSS, LESS, Font, or any other styles that the application uses. Unless you want to change any styles in the application, 
        you will not need to go into this directory since I have already added some styling to get you started.</dd>
      <dt>root/index.html</dt>
      <dd>
        Open this file in browser to open the application. There is no need to have multiple html pages, 
        since this is a Single Page Application (SPA).
        In this particular tutorial, this is where you will add your html view templates at.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>App Directory</h2>
    <p>Now lets open the app directory and see the structure in there.</p>
    <div class="fig">
      <img src="images/backbone-tutorial-fig1_2b.jpg">
      <div class="fig-title">Fig 1.3 (root/app)</div>
    </div>
    <dl>
      <dt>root/app/collections</dt>
      <dd>Stores the appliaction's Collection Classes.</dd>
      <dt>root/app/models</dt>
      <dd>Stores the application's Model Classes.</dd>
      <dt>root/app/services</dt>
      <dd>Stores the application's Service Classes.</dd>
      <dt>root/app/vendor</dt>
      <dd>Stores all 3rd party files, such as Backbone, Bootstrap, Underscore, and etc...</dd>
      <dt>root/app/views</dt>
      <dd>Stores the application's views.</dd>
      <dt>root/app/app.js</dt>
      <dd>Binds and configures tasks for the application, before actually starting the application.</dd>
      <dt>root/app/exe.js</dt>
      <dd>
        Waits for the document to be ready and/or device ready if the 
        application is for a Cordova Project, before running the application 
        (app.js).
      </dd>
      <dt>root/app/require-config.js</dt>
      <dd>
        Configuration file for RequireJS. Requirejs isn't required for a 
        Backbone Application, however I like to use it for my applications. 
        If you want to know more about RequireJS, I will eventually have an 
        article dissucssing it in more detail, but you can learn more at 
        <a href="http://requirejs.org/">http://requirejs.org/</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>root/app/router.js</dt>
      <dd>Configures the application router's page states.</dd>
    </dl>
    <footer>
      You can take a look at any files you wish to kind of get a better 
      understanding, some of the files I have already coded for you, such as 
      the <b>require-config</b> file, so you can concentrate on just Backone 
      related programming. Once you are finished, go ahead and continue to 
      the next section and learn about Backbone Views.
